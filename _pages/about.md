I started this blog to document the various challenges I encountered while developing and the intricacies of different settings. These days, it seems like AI knows everything, but I wonder if it will also learn the content of this blog? I hope it can be of some small help to someone, and it has been a valuable experience for me in many ways, so I want to share this experience.

The content of the posts may be somewhat inadequate or lacking. _I'm not particularly skilled at writing_, so they may not be structured perfectly. However, I'll try my best to refine them through multiple revisions so that they ultimately become easy to read.

This blog is hosted using GitHub Pages with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). And this post was translated with the help of **ChatGPT** ðŸ™‚
